        <h1>Crown shyness</h1>
        <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
        <p> Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2] or inter-crown spacing[3]) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully 
            stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
            between trees of different species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]

        <p>The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.[6] The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to “reciprocal pruning” 
            of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies 
            suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical 
            abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artificially</p>
